* make sure to disable CPU specific optimization, e.g. in GMP

* perhaps delete all *.la file (in the install.sh files)?
  they have the build PATH baked in, which is bad for a reloctable
  system.
  When doing that, make sure nothing breaks

* GAP: after running its outer (and inner?) configure script,
  overwrite the GAParch value with something that works across OS X
  versions

* look at Max' N.s "bob" and see if we can learn from it
  https://github.com/neunhoef/bob
  https://github.com/neunhoef/bob/blob/master/bob.cc
  https://github.com/neunhoef/bob/blob/master/gap.cc

* look at "polybundle" by Silke and Andreas:
  https://github.com/polymake/polybundle

* make all libraries relocatable using 

* prepare scripts that create a GAP.app bundle; perhaps also look at the
  polybundle for that

* prepare scripts that create a disk image from that, using
    https://github.com/fingolfin/make-dmg

* create a virtual machine with Mac OS X 10.6 or so, and create the
  disk image there. Then test it on various machines

* right now, GAP packages are all built as part of "GAP". It might be better
  if each GAP package that requires compilation is covered by its
  own "package".

* add SingularInterface

* add NormalizInterface

* bug in GAP: if HOME or PATH env vars are not setup, GAP crashes
  during startup with strange errors. THere should be a proper error check
